`styledTables` is an **R** package that makes it possible to export a
`data.frame` as beautifully styled **Excel** and **LaTeX** table.

> Produce tables, which you want to look at.

Have a look at the \[get started vignette\] to see `styledTables` in
action.

## Caution

The `styledTables` package is deprecated and will soon be relaunched
under the package name `styledtable`. This package will have its main
focus on HTML based reports (see <https://pagedown.rbind.io/>), which
are fully accessible to assistive reading devices and come along with
all the nice bookbinding features that LaTeX offers. Unfortunately,
there wonâ€™t be any more support for this legacy package.

If you still want to use the deprecated `styledTables` package:

``` r
# Install last stable version from GitHub
devtools::install_github('R-package/styledTables', build_opts = NULL)
```
